# Detailed Project Plan (AI-Driven Development)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing the A-EMS project, leveraging an AI-driven software development lifecycle (SDLC). The goal is to use AI assistants at every stage—from planning and design to coding, testing, and documentation—to accelerate development and improve quality.

## 2. Gap Analysis

- **Current State:** The project is at inception. We have a `README.md` file, a project vision, and a defined tech stack. There is no code, architecture, or infrastructure.
- **Desired State:** A fully functional web application, "A-EMS," serving as a "Digital Chief of Staff" with comprehensive microservices backend, advanced analytics capabilities, and AI-powered insights across all business domains.
- **The Gap:** The entire application ecosystem needs to be designed, developed, tested, and deployed. This includes:
  - **Backend:** Multiple domain-specific microservices (Sales, Finance, HR), advanced analytics engines, database schemas, and comprehensive business logic.
  - **Frontend:** Sophisticated UI/UX components, interactive dashboards, advanced data visualizations, state management, and seamless API integrations.
  - **Infrastructure:** Docker orchestration, monitoring, logging, and deployment automation.
  - **AI Integration:** Advanced prompt engineering, context management, and intelligent data aggregation for the DeepSeek model.

## 3. AI-Driven Development Process & Phases

This project will be executed in phases, with AI assisting at each step.

### Phase 1: Foundation & System Design (Current Phase)

- **Objective:** Establish the project's technical and organizational foundation.
- **Tasks:**
  1.  **Project Scaffolding (AI-Assisted):**
      - `[Done]` Generate core documentation (`Project_Info_Scope.md`, `Project_Plan.md`, etc.) using an AI assistant based on the initial prompt.
      - `[Done]` Create the initial directory structure (`backend`, `frontend`, `infra`, `docs`).
  2.  **System Architecture Design (AI-Assisted):**
      - Use AI to draft the `System_Architecture.md` document, outlining the microservices, data flow, and cloud deployment strategy.
  3.  **UI/UX Wireframing (AI-Assisted):**
      - Generate initial concepts and component breakdowns in `UI_UX.md` to guide frontend development.
  4.  **API & Data Modeling (AI-Assisted):**
      - Draft the initial `API_Specification.md` and database schema designs with AI suggestions.

### Phase 2: Backend Microservice Development

- **Objective:** Build the core backend services for each business domain.
- **AI-Driven Workflow:**

  1.  **Boilerplate Generation:** Use AI to generate boilerplate code for each FastAPI microservice (`Sales`, `Finance`, `HR`, etc.), including Dockerfiles and basic endpoints based on `API_Specification.md`.
  2.  **Logic Implementation:** Implement business logic for each service with AI providing code snippets, suggestions, and bug fixes.
  3.  **Database Integration:** Generate SQLAlchemy models and database interaction logic for each service, potentially within its own schema.
  4.  **Unit & Integration Testing:** Generate test cases and testing scripts to ensure each microservice is reliable and meets its API contract.### Phase 3: Frontend Development

- **Objective:** Develop the user-facing Next.js application.
- **AI-Driven Workflow:**
  1.  **Component Scaffolding:** Use AI to generate React/TypeScript components based on the `UI_UX.md` document and Tailwind CSS.
  2.  **Page & Layout Creation:** Build the main pages (Dashboard, Chat) and implement routing.
  3.  **State Management:** Implement state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit) with AI guidance.
  4.  **API Integration:** Connect the frontend to the backend APIs, with AI helping to write data-fetching hooks and handle responses.
  5.  **Visualization:** Use AI to generate code for the `Recharts` library to build dashboard widgets.

### Phase 4: AI & Docker Integration

- **Objective:** Containerize the application and integrate the AI assistant.
- **AI-Driven Workflow:**
  1.  **Docker Compose:** Create and refine the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `infra` directory to orchestrate all services (backend, frontend, database).
  2.  **AI Service Integration:** Develop the service responsible for communicating with the DeepSeek API. Use AI to assist with prompt engineering and API request/response handling.
  3.  **End-to-End Testing:** Manually test the full application flow, from user login to asking a question to the AI and seeing data on the dashboard.

## 4. Timeline

- **Phase 1:** 1-2 days
- **Phase 2:** 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4:** 1 week

This timeline is aggressive and relies heavily on the effective use of AI development tools to meet targets.
