# Detailed Project Plan (AI-Driven Development)

_Last updated: 14/09/2025_

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing the A-EMS project, leveraging an AI-driven software development lifecycle (SDLC). The goal is to use AI assistants at every stage—from planning and design to coding, testing, and documentation—to accelerate development and improve quality.

## 2. Gap Analysis

- **Current State:** The project is at inception. We have a `README.md` file, a project vision, and a defined tech stack. There is no code, architecture, or infrastructure.
- **Desired State:** A fully functional web application, "A-EMS," serving as a "Digital Chief of Staff" with comprehensive microservices backend, advanced analytics capabilities, and AI-powered insights across all business domains.
- **The Gap:** The entire application ecosystem needs to be designed, developed, tested, and deployed. This includes:
  - **Backend:** Multiple domain-specific microservices (Sales, Finance, HR), advanced analytics engines, database schemas, and comprehensive business logic.
  - **Frontend:** Sophisticated UI/UX components, interactive dashboards, advanced data visualizations, state management, and seamless API integrations.
  - **Infrastructure:** Docker orchestration, monitoring, logging, and deployment automation.
  - **AI Integration:** Advanced prompt engineering, context management, and intelligent data aggregation for the DeepSeek model.

## 3. AI-Driven Development Process & Phases

This project will be executed in phases, with AI assisting at each step.

### Phase 1: Foundation & System Design (Current Phase)

- **Objective:** Establish the project's technical and organizational foundation.
- **Tasks:**

      - Generate core documentation (`Project_Info_Scope.md`, `Project_Plan.md`, etc.) using an AI assistant based on the initial prompt.
      - Create the initial directory structure (`backend`, `frontend`, `infra`, `docs`).
      - Develop comprehensive logging strategy and implementation guide (`Logging_Guide.md`).
  2.  **System Architecture Design (AI-Assisted):**
      - Use AI to draft the `System_Architecture.md` document, outlining the microservices, data flow, and cloud deployment strategy.
      - Integrate logging flows and monitoring architecture into system design.
  3.  **UI/UX Wireframing (AI-Assisted):**
      - Generate initial concepts and component breakdowns in `UI_UX.md` to guide frontend development.
      - Define error handling and user notification patterns.
  4.  **API & Data Modeling (AI-Assisted):**
      - Draft the comprehensive `API_Specification.md` with enhanced AI endpoint suite including:
        - Multi-turn conversation management (`/ai/chat`)
        - Session history and context management (`/ai/history`, `/ai/context/reset`)
        - Real-time streaming responses (`/ai/stream`)
        - Analytics and feedback systems (`/ai/analytics`, `/ai/feedback`)
        - Contextual suggestions (`/ai/suggestions`)
      - Design database schemas with conversation persistence and analytics tracking

      - **Logging Implementation:** Set up structured logging with correlation IDs for all auth operations

  2.  **Security Features Implementation:**

      - Session management with device tracking
      - Brute force protection and account lockout
      - Security audit logging and monitoring
      - Rate limiting and DDoS protection
      - Secure JWT token handling and storage
      - **Security Monitoring:** Real-time alerting for authentication failures and suspicious activities

  3.  **Authentication UI Development:**
      - Login/logout interfaces with MFA support
      - Password management forms and flows
      - Google OAuth integration components
      - Admin user management dashboard
      - Account security settings interface
      - **Error Handling:** Implement React Error Boundary and toast notification system for authentication flows

### Phase 3: Backend Microservice Development

- **Objective:** Build the core backend services for each business domain.
- **AI-Driven Workflow:**

  1.  **Boilerplate Generation:** Use AI to generate boilerplate code for each FastAPI microservice (`Sales`, `Finance`, `HR`, etc.), including Dockerfiles and basic endpoints based on `API_Specification.md`.
  2.  **Logic Implementation:** Implement business logic for each service with AI providing code snippets, suggestions, and bug fixes.
  3.  **Database Integration:** Generate SQLAlchemy models and database interaction logic for each service, potentially within its own schema.
  4.  **Logging Integration:** Implement structured JSON logging with correlation ID middleware for all microservices, following patterns in `Logging_Guide.md`.
  5.  **Unit & Integration Testing:** Generate test cases and testing scripts to ensure each microservice is reliable and meets its API contract.

### Phase 4: Frontend Development

- **Objective:** Develop the user-facing Next.js application.
