## Epic: Executive Dashboard

**As a CEO, I want a real-time, scannable dashboard so that I can quickly assess the overall health and performance of my business.**

- **US-101:** As a CEO, I want to see high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Total Revenue, New Customers, and Churn Rate at the top of my dashboard so I can get an instant snapshot of the business.
- **US-102:** As a CEO, I want to view a line chart of our Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) for the past 12 months so I can understand our growth trajectory.
- **US-103:** As a CEO, I want to see a bar chart comparing sales across different regions for the current quarter so I can identify top-performing areas.
- **US-104:** As a CEO, I want to view key financial KPIs like Gross Margin and Net Profit on my dashboard so I can quickly assess profitability.
- **US-105:** As a CEO, I want to see the current employee headcount and monthly turnover rate so I can keep a pulse on organizational health.
- **US-106:** As a CEO, I want the dashboard data to refresh automatically or with a single click so I am always looking at the most current information.

## Epic: AI Chat Assistant

**As a CEO, I want to ask questions about my business in plain English so that I can get specific insights without needing to navigate complex menus or reports.**

- **US-201:** As a CEO, I want to open a chat interface and ask a simple sales question like "What was our total revenue last month?" and receive a clear, text-based answer.
- **US-202:** As a CEO, I want to ask a comparative question like "Compare revenue in Q1 vs Q2" and get a summary of the results.
- **US-203:** As a CEO, I want to ask a finance-related question like "What were our main expenses last quarter?" and get a breakdown by category.
- **US-204:** As a CEO, I want to ask for a visualization, such as "Show me a pie chart of headcount by department," and have the chart rendered directly in the chat window.
- **US-205:** As a CEO, I want the AI to have context of our conversation, so I can ask follow-up questions like "And what about the previous quarter?" without restating the original topic (e.g., revenue).
- **US-206:** As a CEO, I want the AI to tell me when it cannot answer a question or doesn't have the right data, so I know the limits of the system.

## Epic: User Authentication & Security

**As a system administrator, I want secure user authentication so that only authorized personnel can access sensitive company data.**

- **US-301:** As a user, I want to log in with my email and password to access the A-EMS application.
- **US-302:** As a user, I want my session to remain active as I navigate the application but to be logged out after a period of inactivity.
- **US-303:** As a system, all communication between the frontend and backend must be encrypted (HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
