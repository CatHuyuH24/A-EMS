# Project Information and Scope

## 1. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** A-EMS (AI-Driven Enterprise Management System)
- **Vision:** To build a "Digital Chief of Staff," an intelligent virtual assistant that provides CEOs and senior leadership with comprehensive information, deep insights, and real-time, data-driven decision-making capabilities.
- **Core Goal:** To transform raw business data into actionable intelligence, presented through an intuitive and interactive web application.

## 2. Core Features

1.  **Executive Dashboard:** A comprehensive, real-time visualization of key business metrics (KPIs), financial health, operational performance, and market trends.
2.  **AI Chat Assistant (DeepSeek Integration):** An interactive chat interface allowing users to ask natural language questions about their business data and receive immediate, insightful answers.
3.  **Microservices Backend:** A scalable and resilient backend architecture to support data processing, API services, and AI model integration.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts (for visualizations).
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker for containerization and consistent development/deployment environments.
- **AI:** DeepSeek model for the intelligent assistant feature.

## 4. Project Scope

### In-Scope:

- Development of the frontend application with a focus on the Executive Dashboard and AI chat interface.
- Implementation of a microservices-based backend to handle authentication, data ingestion, and API endpoints.
- Containerization of the entire application stack using Docker.
- Integration with the DeepSeek AI to enable natural language queries.
- Initial setup of a PostgreSQL database.

### Out-of-Scope (for initial phase):

- Advanced, multi-source data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.
- Mobile application development.
- Multi-tenancy architecture.
- On-premise deployment (initial focus is on a containerized cloud-ready solution).

## 5. Proposed Directory Structure

To ensure a clean and scalable project, the following directory structure is proposed:
