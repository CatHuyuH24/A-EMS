## The Journey: "Morning Business Health Check"

**Trigger:** Alex starts their workday and wants to understand what happened yesterday and how the quarter is progressing.

1.  **Login:**

    - Alex navigates to `a-ems.app.com`.
    - They are presented with a clean login screen.
    - Alex enters their email and password and clicks "Log In".
    - The system authenticates them and redirects to the main Executive Dashboard.

2.  **Dashboard Overview (The "10,000 Foot View"):**

    - The dashboard loads, immediately showing the main KPIs.
    - Alex glances at the top-level cards:
      - **Revenue:** Looks good, slightly above target.
      - **New Users:** On track.
      - **Churn Rate:** Alex notices this is slightly elevated, colored in amber. This catches their attention.
    - They look at the MRR trend line chart. The growth is steady, which is reassuring.

3.  **Initial Investigation (Using the AI Chat):**

    - Alex's focus is now on the increased churn rate. Instead of digging through reports, they turn to the AI.
    - Alex clicks on the "AI Chat" link in the sidebar.
    - The chat interface opens with a greeting: "Good morning, Alex. How can I help you?"
    - Alex types: _"Why was churn higher last month?"_

4.  **Interactive Drill-Down (Conversational Analysis):**

    - The AI processes the request. It might access customer data, subscription info, and support tickets.
    - **AI Response:** "Churn last month was 3.2%, up from 2.5% the previous month. The increase was primarily driven by customers on the 'Basic' plan. We also saw a correlation with a recent pricing update."
    - This is an interesting insight. Alex wants to see the data.
    - Alex types: _"Show me a chart of churn by customer plan for the last 3 months."_
    - **AI Response:** The AI renders a bar chart directly in the chat window, clearly showing the 'Basic' plan churn spiking in the most recent month.

5.  **Actionable Insight:**

    - Thanks to the quick interaction, Alex has moved from a high-level concern (increased churn) to a specific, actionable insight (the 'Basic' plan is the problem, likely related to a pricing change).
    - They now have a concrete topic to discuss with their Head of Product.

6.  **Logout:**
    - Having completed their morning check-in, Alex clicks on their profile icon and selects "Logout".
    - They are returned to the login screen.
